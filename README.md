## Components
- **Sushi-Config.yaml:** Configuration file for SUSHI, a tool that converts FSH files into FHIR resources.
- **Profiles and Extensions:** Custom FHIR profiles and extensions created as part of the project, located in the `input/fsh` directory.
- **Aliases.fsh:** Contains aliases used across different FSH files for code system URLs, also located in the `input/fsh` directory.

## Building the Implementation Guide
To build the Implementation Guide, ensure you have the FHIR IG Publisher tool setup. Run the publisher with the project directory as the input. For detailed instructions, refer to the [FHIR IG Publisher documentation](http://hl7.org/fhir/igpublisher.html).
